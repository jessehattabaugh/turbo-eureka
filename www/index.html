	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>
		TurboEureka is a racing game in the style of the Mode7 racers on the SNES such as F-Zero, Mario Kart, and Street
		Racer. The game is built with raw web components apis and no libraries or frameworks. Since the game is built
		with web components, players can customize the cars and tracks using only web technologies.
	</p>

	<button id="start-game">Start Game</button>

	<h2>The World</h2>

	<p>The world is composed of a ground, some number of obstacles, a sky, and some number of karts. The kart remains
		mostly centered on the screen, while the track. The track is a 2D plane that is rotated and scaled to simulate a
		3D track. The sky is a background behind it that uses paralax scrolling to simulate rotation. The karts and
		obstacles are sprites placed in the correct location on the ground to simulate 3D position. As the player's kart
		moves around the ground, the world keeps the kart in the center while rotating, scaling and translating the
		ground to approximate a position on the track.</p>

	<h2>Grounds</h2>

	<p>Grounds are composed of a ground texture and a ground track path. These can be provided to the Ground component
		using the groundtexture slot, and the groundcollision slot. The ground collision is provided as an SVG vector.
	</p>

	<h2>Skies</h2>
	<p>Skies are a paralax scrolling and repeating pattern that can be placed behind a subject to simulate rotation.</p>

	<h2>Karts</h2>

	<p>Karts are composed of a kart body and a kart wheels. These can be provided to the Kart component using the
		kartbody slot, and the kartwheel slot.</p>

	<h2>Obstacles</h2>
	<p>Obstacles are Matter.js Bodies that are placed on the track to provide a challenge to the player. The obstacles
		are placed on the track using the Obstacle component.</p>

	<h2>Controls</h2>
	<p>The controls fall back to keyboard; A and D keys, as well as left and right keys for steering, W for gas, and S
		for brake. However, if you have a controller connected and you press a button a menu will appear that asks you
		to chose the function of each button on your controller. The controls are managed by the Game element. Also
		there will be touch controls.</p>
